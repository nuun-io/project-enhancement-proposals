= Abstract

This PEP is about a new fluent API for plugins which could complement the traditional API (modernized with PEP 002 or not).
This new API make uses of one-method interfaces to enable lambda coding in the plugins themselves. The API is still
backwards compatible with Java 6 & 7.

The result is a drastic reduction of boilerplate code and a simplification of the plugin interface (named FluentPlugin in
this pep). The use of "closures" and the ability to install modules directly from the init method enable to avoid keeping
state in the plugin itself.  

= Specification

This PEP is specified as a Proof-Of-Concept under the [pep_003_poc](pep_003_poc) directory. This should be compiled with
Java 8, as the example plugins use lambda and streams (but plugins can be written without).
