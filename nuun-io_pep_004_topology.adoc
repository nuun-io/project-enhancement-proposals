= Abstract

Enhance the DX (Developer eXperience) of nuun to allow developpers to easily create applications.

- First, provide a simple starter from main to handle/hide kernel mechanisms.
- Then provide a simple way to define the object graph of the application.

= Motivation =

Nuun has been designed to supply high level API and SPI to stack/libs/frameworks authors.

This PEP is motivated by the fact that the lambda developer can not use nuun directly, as too many concepts have to be known and mastered before the creation of a minimal application?


= Specification

== NuunRunner

The `NuunRunner` has to be ran from a simple main of the developper application.

[source,java]
----
// ...
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
       NuunRunner.run(MyEntryPoint.class , args); 
    }
// ...
----
It takes as first parameter an `EntryPoint√® class and in second the args from the main.

We're defining the `EntryPoint` in the next section.

== EntryPoint

We introduce the `EntryPoint` annotation which will annotate the application start class.

The application class is just a pojo holder.

[source,java]
----
@Entrypoint(packageScan="io.nuun.appli1")
public class MyEntrypoint implements Runnable
{
     // 
}
----

The `EntryPoint` annotation has one mandatory value `packageScan`, which indicate the packages in which scanning the classpath.

Basically, the `NuunRunner` could be launch from the `EntryPoint`.

[source,java]
----
@EntryPoint(packageScan="io.nuun.appli1")
public class MyApplication
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
       NuunRunner.entrypoint(MyApplication.class).execute(args); 
    }
}
----

== Topology

A Topology is a java interface annotated with @Topologywhich will describe the bindings, AOP of your annotation.

Topologies can compare with spring javaconfig, but topologies are interfaces not POJO.

Topologies are declaratives not imperatives, they do not need to be unit tested (who is unit testing its spring java config class anyway ;p )

We follow an easy to read convention to indicate what to bind, on what key with which qualifiers etc etc.

=== Simple example

[source,java]
----
// a topology with one binding defined
@Topology
public class MyTopology
{
    MyServiceImpl binds(MyService key);                                            
}
----

In this simple example we define that MyService interface will be bound to MyServiceImpl class as implementation. 

[source,java]
----
@EntryPoint(packageScan="io.nuun.appli1")
public class MyApplication
{
    @Inject
    private MyService myService;

    public void run() {
        //
        myService.doStuff();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
       NuunRunner.run(MyApplication.class , args); 
    }
}

----
=== Complete example

A more complete example

[source,java]
----
@Topology
public interface MyAppTopology
{
    // Constant definition
    @Server
    Long port = 8080l;
    
    @Server
    String url = "http://localhost.local";

    // Binding 
    MyServiceImpl binds(MyService key);

    // Bindings with qualifier
    HisServiceImpl1 bindsOne(@One HisService key); // One is a qualifier
    HisServiceImpl3 bindsTwo(@Named("Three") HisService key);
    // or
    // another way to declare a qualifier
    HisServiceImpl2 bindsTwo(Class<Two> qualifier, HisService key);
    
    // Direct Binding + Eager
    @Eager // nuun annotation , non jsr 
    MyObject binds(MyObject key);

    // Use of JSR330 provider
    @Singleton // jsr330
    MyService2Provider provides(MyService2 key);

    // A.O.P.
    MyMethodInterceptor intercepts(Predicate<Class<?>> pc, Predicate<Method> pm);

   // Custom Annotation to be injected 
   MyLoggerFieldInjector isInjectedBy(MyLogger annotation); 
       
}
----

== Overriding existing binding

== Tests
= Internals

This feature will be handle by a plugin that won't be declared inside `META-INF/services` but activated by NuunRunner when launching the kernel.

== Meta Annotation support

Topology annotation will support annotation on annotation. To create custom annotations.
