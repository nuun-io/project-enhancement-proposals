The Nuun.IO PEP repository tracks significant technical or functional changes of Nuun.IO.

A PEP is a description that allow to understand what the change is and what is the motivation behind it. It is a markdown file, always beginning with 3 informations: 

- A numeric identifier , 
- A title,
- A status (draft, pending, accepted or refused).

It is strongly recommended to follow the following layout for the PEP:

- Abstract,
- Motivation,
- Specification.

A PEP should always be associated with a pull request for discussion during the drafting of the proposal.
